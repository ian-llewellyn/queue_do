classes:
- Configuration
- JobQueue
- InotifyWait
- Processor

In order for the inotifywait daemons to run, they must know what configuration to use:
InotifyWait -> Configuration

InotifyWait then pushes jobs onto the JobQueue. These jobs reference the Configuration:
JobQueue -> Configuration

In order for the job to be processed, the Processor must reference the JobQueue
Processor -> JobQueue


TODO
- Daemonize: perhaps split the bulk of the running code to a separate file in the base of the project.
- --retry-failed argument: ensure that the sort order is correct, and keeps failed items at the bottom.
- --foreground argument: Don't daemonise the program.
- logging
